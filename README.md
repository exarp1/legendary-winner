# Advanced React & GraphQL Course project - "Sick Fits"

This is my (eventually) completed project from the excellent "Fullstack Advanced React &amp; GraphQL" course, as taught by Wes Bos.

These are the starter files and stepped solutions for the [Advanced React & GraphQL](https://AdvancedReact.com) course by [Wes Bos](https://WesBos.com/).

* This repo is based on the starter files, and the lessons in the course.

* I'll likely make some minor changes to the code as I go along, but I would like
to stick to the recommended code for the most part so it compiles and runs.

* I am considering using Typescript for this, but I am unsure if the investment
of time is worthwhile.
